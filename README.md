# classify-chest-X-rays-as-normal-pneumonia-or-covid-
Assignment:

For this assignment, you will classify chest X-rays as "normal," "pneumonia," or "covid" using Convolutional Neural Networks.

Download the data here. Unzip the file and add it to your assignment repo. You've already worked with this dataset in the Tensorflow Dataset Objects lesson.
   - Note: Extract the zip file and then add the image folders to your local machine.
     
   - When committing your work to Github, you can ignore the folder that contains the images.

Note: In GitHub desktop, on the changes sidebar, you should see every individual image. Scroll through the list until you see the folder name the images are in. Right-click on that folder and Select “Ignore File (add to gitignore)."​

For this assignment, your goal is to get as high of an accuracy as possible, applying all of the techniques and tools covered this week.

Try to improve the accuracy from your baseline model. (+90% accuracy is attainable)
